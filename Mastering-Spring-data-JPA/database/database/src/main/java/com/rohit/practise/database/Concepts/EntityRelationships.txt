@many-to-many

course can have many students
many students can have multiple courses enrolled into.

@one-to-one
    student can have only one passport.
    passport can only be associated with only one person/student.
    This is an eager fetch. if student is retrieved, passport is automatically retrieved along with it.
    @OneToOne(fetchtype=lazy)
        only when I am asking for passport details, passport details are retrieved.
        you have to put @Transactional on the test case, when you are doing multiple transaction
        especially in case of lazy fetch.

@many-to-one
    course with many reviews
    review can be assoc with only one course.
